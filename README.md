# An Attempt at a Text Based RPG with React and a Rails:API

This is an attempt at a React-Redux SPA frontend UI for a text-based RPG.

##Installation Guide
Feels free to fork this repo and work on it if you want.

##Additional Information

- At this stage, I have got the user registration and session completed (I hope). 
- I started working on the character creation and show pages.
- The next step to complete is get the user creation done and then start working on the game itself.
